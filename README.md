# Scale Embeddings with Snowflake Notebooks on Container Runtime

## Overview
[Snowflake Notebooks on Container Runtime](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ui-snowsight/notebooks-on-spcs) are a powerful IDE option for building ML workloads at scale. Container Runtime (Public Preview) gives you a flexible container infrastructure that supports building and operationalizing a wide variety of resource-intensive ML workflows entirely within Snowflake. 

This notebook demonstrates how you can load an open source embedding model, generate embeddings using a GPU, evaluate a dataset for a RAG solution, deploy the embedding model, perform large scale batch inference, and save results to a Snowflake table without a lot of complex infrastructure setup and management.
